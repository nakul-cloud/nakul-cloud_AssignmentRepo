The Solidity contract provided implements a simple lottery system on the Ethereum blockchain. Here's a brief description of how it works:

Contract Deployment:

The contract is deployed by a user, who becomes the manager of the lottery.

Participation:

Anyone can participate in the lottery by sending exactly 1 ether to the contract. This is facilitated by the receive function, which is triggered when the contract receives ether.

The participant's address is added to the participants array.

Checking the Balance:

The getBalance function allows the manager to view the total balance of the contract. This function ensures that only the manager can access this information.

Generating a Random Number:

The random function generates a pseudo-random number using the block.prevrandao, block.timestamp, and the length of the participants array. This number is used to select a winner.

Selecting a Winner:

The selectWinner function allows the manager to pick a winner. It uses the random number generated by the random function to select an index from the participants array.

The selected winner receives the entire balance of the contract.

After selecting a winner, the participants array is reset to an empty state, ready for the next round of the lottery.
